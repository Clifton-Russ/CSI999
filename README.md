Instructions on how to run the code and reproduce the results. 
All code is written in Matlab. Ensure that you have the latest version.

Scenario 1: Select the Scenario 1 matlab file.
  Scenario 1 tests various trials. The values of certain attributes dictate the run time duration. Most notably, lines 5 (a_size_total) and 6 (days) have the largest impact. The variable "a_size_total" represents
  the number of agents, while the variable "days" represents the number of days.

  Ensure that the Matlab Riboon is under "Editor".
  You have the choice of using the "Run Section" button (which only runs a particular section divided by the double percentage signs), ""Run and Advance" (does Run Section, but moves the cursor to the next section)
  or the large "Run" button, which runs the entire page. For Scenario 1, it is advised to use the "Run and Advance" button after each section compiles.


Scenario 2:
  Scenario 2 has it's own folder. 
  After selecting the Scenario 2 folder and Scenario 2 file, simply hit the large Run button. 

Scenario 3:
  If you want see the results from the study, change the Matlab ribbon to "Apps" and select "Classificatioin Learner"
  Once the window opens up, select "open" and navigate to the "Model Results" folder"
  Scenario 3 Trial 2 Findings are located in the self named folder
    Once you select either of the findings, wait until the classification learner loads
    Under the Models section, next to "sort by", select the down arrow to choose the accuracy, precision, F1 or Recall scores for the validation or test
    Feel free to explore the ribbon for other charts, graphs and options

  Under the "Other findings" folders include Trial 1 and the remaining of Trial 2. These findings include the results from eaach trial with exploit thresholds of 1,2,3 and 4. Trial 2 with 3 thresholds is what the
  research uses. This is why it has its own folder.


 Alternatively, you can manually run "Scenario 3" and use the classification learner to train new models.
